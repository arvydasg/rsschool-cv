### About myself:

Hello. My name is Arvydas. I am 27 years old and this is how my life looked like since I have left Lithuania in 2013.

* **2013** - Finished Juozas Miltinis Gymnasium in Panevezys.
* **2013-2018** - Getting my Bachelor in "Architectural Technology and Construction Management" in a Danish University.
* **2018-2020** - Walking the Camino in Spain with my bag and a hammock, hitchhiking around Europe, visiting around 10 Asian countries, attending/volunteering in different meditation/yoga courses.
* **2020-2022** - Back to Lithuania for real. Tinkering with all the possible programming fields since the beginning of 2021 (Operating systems (kali Linux, Ubuntu, Arch Linux), code editors (emacs, vim), various programming languages (lisp, python), all sorts of front end stuff and so on...). Building websites for friends and clients, ecommerce shops with Wordpress, using and tinkering with Linux system daily, creating various automation bots with Python that makes my and businesses that I help lifes easiers and more productive. On top of that getting to know to online marketing, providing SEO, Google Tag Manager or Facebook ads services to businesses.
* **2022** - Since the beginning of this year I am working as a DPD courier - a job that I want to get out of as soon as possible, so I can spend more time doing what I like most - sitting in front of computer and programming instead of being stuck in a snow pile with a Van full of parcels somewhere in a middle of nowhere :)

p.s. I also really appreaciate the ability a skill such as "Programming" provides in some cases - Remote Work. I really like travelling, so I job that I can properly perform fully remotely is my goal.

### Code Examples:

A few of my most recent projects:

#### Facebook Group Automation bot  - https://github.com/arvydasg/facebook_django

Facebook automation bot that lets you input text, url and choose groups from excel file that you want the bot to post to and it does it to however many groups you want. Such bot is really useful and saves a lot of time when I am doing some facebook marketing for my and my girlfriends little business that we have - [smutifruti.lt]http://smutifruti.lt/

#### Django database + Frontend - [dpd2022.herokuapp.com]https://dpd2022.herokuapp.com/

**GitHub link** - https://github.com/arvydasg/dpd

A site that I made as a practice, but will use it for myself and hopefully my colleagues as well. A place where couriers at the end of each work day can input their "points". Useful for those who want to track the money they made during each and every month.

This project has a lot of potential, I am very eager to develop it more.

### Education:

* 2013-2018 - Bachelor in "Architectural Technology and Construction Management" in a Danish University.

Also I have dipped my toes in some of other online courses, but I haven't finished any of those. Most of the time I end up doing my own projects after learning something new and cool.

### English:

I speak fluent English. For the last 9 years (education, travels, international friends..) -  English was the language I have used on a daily basis.
